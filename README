D&D Character Creator

Overview

The D&D Character Creator is a terminal-based Java application designed to help players generate characters for Dungeons & Dragons. This project serves as a fun and interactive tool for 
creating unique D&D characters while allowing me to deepen my understanding of Java programming. The character creation process includes selecting classes, races, and rolling for stats 
using official D&D rules, with a modular and extensible design for future updates.



Features

- Class and Race Selection: 
  - Choose from iconic D&D classes (e.g., Barbarian, Wizard) and races (e.g., Human, Elf, Tiefling).  
  - Each class and race is implemented using a modular and extensible structure.

- Stat Generation:
  - Rolls for stats using the standard D&D method: roll 4 six-sided dice, drop the lowest roll, and sum the rest.  

- Modularity:
  - The project is designed to be highly modular, with individual classes for character race, class, and stats.  
  - An abstract class (`ClassGen`) serves as a template for specific class implementations.

- Extensibility:
  - Future updates will include additional features like multiclassing, random name generation, adding equipment and possibly a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. 
    (These are all just when I have time to work on this)

Why I Built This

This project was created for both fun and as a learning exercise to:
- Strengthen my understanding of Java.
- Demonstrate advanced Java concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- Practice modular design principles for scalability and maintainability.



Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java  
- Development Environment: Visual Studio Code  
- Libraries: Built-in Java libraries (e.g., `java.util.Scanner`, `java.util.Random`, `java.util.Arrays`).


Installation and Usage

Prerequisites
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) installed.  
- A terminal or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) to run the program.

Steps
1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/ethanamessmer/DNDCharacterMaker.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd DnD-Character-Creator
   
3. Compile the Java files:
   
   javac *.java Classes/*.java
   
4. Run the program:
   1. navigate to charMaker in bash
   2. run - java charMaker

Planned Features

- Random Name Generation: Automatically create names based on race and class.  
- Multiclassing: Support for characters with multiple classes.  
- Equipment: Adding equipment such as weapons, armor and others hopefully from a DB.
- Graphical Interface: Replace terminal input with a Java Swing-based GUI.  
- Save and Load Characters**: Persist character data for future sessions.
